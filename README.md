# Rusty Merkle Tree


### Merkle Proof of Inclusion
Merkle proofs are used to decide upon the following factors:

- If the data belongs in the merkle tree
- To concisely prove the validity of data being part of a dataset without storing the whole data set
- To ensure the validity of a certain data set being inclusive in a larger data set without revealing either the complete data set or its subset.
